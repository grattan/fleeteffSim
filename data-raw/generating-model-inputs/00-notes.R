#notes:

  #' Need to have a standardised rate for inflation and exchange rates. Define these
  #' in the setup file and use them through all inputs
  #'
  #'
  #' probably strip the cost_curves() function back down so it doesn't do all this
  #' unecessary crap. Check that we don't need the running totals in any of the other scripts
