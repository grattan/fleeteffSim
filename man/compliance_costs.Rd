\title{Compliance costs}
\arguments{
\item{.fleet}{The simulated fleet of new vehicle sales. No defaults. Set to \code{.fleet = fleet_crator()} for default fleet assumptions.}

\item{.target_scenario}{The target type selected from \code{targets_and_bau} for the compliance cost run. Options include
"target_central", "bau", "target_linear", "target_ambitious".}

\item{.bau_scenario}{The BAU scenario selected from \code{targets_and_bau} for the compliance cost run. Options include "bau" and "bau_slow". "bau" assumes full EV saturation by 2048, whereas "bau_slow" assumes a 2050 emissions value of ~22-23g/km and no EV saturation.}

\item{.target_file}{The file containing the target scenarios. Should include three columns: `value` (the target emissions), `year`,
and `target_type`}

\item{.cost_curves}{The assumed cost curves for al vehicle types}

\item{.cost_curve_estimate}{The cost curves estimate type}

\item{.suv_existing_tech}{The assumed existing technology for SUVs}

\item{.passenger_existing_tech}{The assumed existing technology for passenger vehicles}

\item{.lcv_existing_tech}{The assumed existing technology for LCVs}

\item{.run_to_year}{The year the function will run until}

\item{.penalty_begin}{The assumed year that targets become binding. This is the start date for the model (inclusive);
prior to the specified year, there is assumed to target benefits, regardless of the target values specified.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with a 'compliant' vehicle fleet, where technology upgrades have been
applied to meet the specified target in each year
}
\description{
A function that estimates the additional production costs of meeting an emissions standard, for a simulated vehicle fleet.
